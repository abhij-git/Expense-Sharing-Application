# Expense Sharing Application

**What to open:** The core backend logic for the assignment is in `convex/` (see `schema.ts`, `expenses.ts`).
Frontend sample UI is in `app/`.

## Requirements (how to run)
1. Install: `npm install`
2. .env variables required (see `.env.example`) — Clerk and Convex keys if you want full functionality.
3. Dev: `npm run dev`

## Quick test (without envs)
- Visit the deployed demo root (or run dev). The homepage is a simple landing page; backend logic can be reviewed directly in `convex/`.

Relevant files: `convex/schema.ts`, `convex/expenses.ts`, `app/(main)/page.jsx`.
